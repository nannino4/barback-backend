## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Backend (NestJS)
- Modular architecture to enable progressive feature addition
- Robust authentication and authorization
- Scalable database design (MongoDB)
- API versioning for backward compatibility
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Message queuing for asynchronous processes
- Caching strategy for performance
- Scheduled jobs for automated processes

### Frontend Considerations
Note: Frontend will be handled as a separate project

### Infrastructure
- Containerized deployment
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup strategy
- GDPR compliance (EU data protection)
- Scalable hosting solution

## Development Approach

1. **Agile Methodology**
   - 2-week sprints
   - Regular user feedback incorporation
   - Feature prioritization based on user value

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - E2E testing for critical paths
   - User acceptance testing with bar partners

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - User guides
   - Technical documentation for future developers

This roadmap serves as a living document that will evolve as development progresses and user feedback is incorporated.
