# Barback Application - Development Roadmap

## Implementation Steps

### MVP Stage

1. **Setup & Infrastructure**
   - Set up NestJS backend with TypeScript
   - Design database schema
   - Implement authentication system
   - Set up testing environment

2. **Core Data Models**
   - User model (with roles)
   - Product model
   - Inventory model
   - Analytics model

3. **API Development**
   - Authentication endpoints
   - Inventory management endpoints
   - Analytics endpoints

4. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Initial deployment to staging
   - Testing with selected bar partners in Rome
   - MVP release

### Middle Stage

1. **Enhanced Data Models**
   - Recipe model
   - Enhanced inventory with locations
   - Order model
   - Supplier model
   - POS integration models

2. **Advanced Features Development**
   - Implement scanning functionality
   - Develop forecasting algorithms
   - Build recipe management system
   - Order management system
   - Supplier management system

3. **Integration Points**
   - Develop supplier integration APIs
   - POS system integration capabilities
   - Build multi-location data synchronization

4. **Testing & Rollout**
   - Beta testing with expanded user group
   - Phased rollout of new features
   - Performance optimization

### Later Stage

1. **AI and Advanced Analytics**
   - Develop machine learning models for prediction
   - Implement data processing pipeline
   - Create advanced visualization tools

2. **Expanded System Capabilities**
   - Financial management module development
   - Marketplace platform development
   - Complete integration framework

3. **Scale Infrastructure**
   - Optimize for larger data volumes
   - Implement advanced caching
   - Enhance security measures
   - Geographic distribution of services

4. **Market Expansion**
   - Localization for international markets
   - Currency and regulatory adaptations
   - Regional supplier networks

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Backend (NestJS)
- Modular architecture to enable progressive feature addition
- Robust authentication and authorization
- Scalable database design (consider PostgreSQL)
- API versioning for backward compatibility
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Message queuing for asynchronous processes
- Caching strategy for performance
- Scheduled jobs for automated processes

### Frontend Considerations
Note: Frontend will be handled as a separate project

### Infrastructure
- Containerized deployment
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup strategy
- GDPR compliance (EU data protection)
- Scalable hosting solution

## Development Approach

1. **Agile Methodology**
   - 2-week sprints
   - Regular user feedback incorporation
   - Feature prioritization based on user value

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - E2E testing for critical paths
   - User acceptance testing with bar partners

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - User guides
   - Technical documentation for future developers

This roadmap serves as a living document that will evolve as development progresses and user feedback is incorporated.
