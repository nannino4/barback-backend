  - [X] Define schema (e.g., name, owner, associated inventories).
  - [X] Define org related user roles: Owner, Manager, Staff.
- [X] **Subscription Model**:
  - [X] Define schema with embedded plan object (eliminates need for separate SubscriptionPlan model).

  - [X] Define schema (e.g., name, category link, unit of measure, par level).
- [X] **Category Model**:
  - [X] Define schema (e.g., name, description) for product categorization.
- [X] **Inventory Model**:
  - [X] Define schema for current stock levels (product link, quantity).
  - [X] Define schema for inventory logs (stock adjustments, reason codes, timestamp, user).
- [X] **Alerts Model**:
  - [X] Define schema (e.g., type - low stock/reminder, target - product/task, threshold, status).
