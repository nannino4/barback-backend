## MVP Stage

### Workspace Setup
- [X] Set up NestJS backend project with TypeScript.
- [X] Define product requirements.
- [X] Define coding guidelines.
- [X] Define testing guidelines.
- [X] Configure ESLint and Prettier according to `CodingGuidelines.md`.
- [X] Configure different environments (dev, test, prod).
- [X] Define logging guidelines and configure logging.

### Define Core Data Models
- [X] **User Model**:
  - [X] Define schema (e.g., email, password hash, Google ID, roles).
  - [X] Define roles: Admin, User.
- [X] **Organization Model**:
  - [X] Define schema (e.g., name, owner, single inventory per organization).
  - [X] Define org related user roles: Owner, Manager, Staff.
- [X] **Subscription Model**:
  - [X] Define schema.
- [X] **Product Model**:
  - [X] Define schema (e.g., name, category link, unit of measure, par level).
- [X] **Category Model**:
  - [X] Define schema (e.g., name, description) for product categorization.
- [X] **Inventory Model**:
  - [X] Define schema for current stock levels integrated into Product model.
  - [X] Define schema for inventory logs (stock adjustments, reason codes, timestamp, user).
- [X] **Alerts Model**:
  - [X] Define schema (e.g., type - low stock/reminder, target - product/task, threshold, status).

### Features

#### Authentication & Authorization
- [X] **User Session Strategy**:
  - [X] Define and implement user session management (e.g., JWT-based).
- [X] **Email/Password Authentication**:
  - [X] Implement User Registration with email and password.
  - [X] Implement Email verification for new accounts
  - [X] Implement User Login with email and password.
  - [X] Implement Password reset functionality via email
- [X] **Google OAuth Authentication**:
  - [X] Implement User Registration with Google OAuth
  - [X] Implement User Login with Google OAuth
- [X] **UserRole-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - [X] Implement guards for UserRoles.
- [X] **User Account Management (Admin)**:
  - [X] Implement Admin functionality to list all users.
  - [X] Implement Admin functionality to view individual user details.
  - [X] Implement Admin functionality to update user profile information.
  - [X] Implement Admin functionality to manage user roles (e.g., assign/revoke Admin role).
  - [X] Implement Admin functionality to manage user account status (e.g., activate/deactivate).
  - [X] Implement Admin functionality to delete user accounts (consider soft delete).
  - [X] Develop API endpoints for these admin user management operations (e.g., under `/admin/users`).
- [X] **User Profile Management (User-Self)**:
  - [X] Allow users to view their own profile information.
  - [X] Allow users to update their own profile information (e.g., name, contact details - excluding email/password which are handled separately).
  - [X] Allow users to change their password (after verifying current password).
  - [X] Allow users to delete their own account (consider implications and data retention policies).
  - [X] Develop API endpoints for these user profile management operations (e.g., under `/users/me`).

#### Email Verification Access Control
Unified guard now restricts authenticated operations until email is verified. Explicit controller-level composition used instead of global `APP_GUARD` for clarity.

- [X] **Implement `EmailVerifiedGuard`**:
  - [X] Guard checks `request.user.isEmailVerified` and throws `EmailNotVerifiedException` (`EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`).
  - [X] Standard payload: `{ statusCode: 403, error: 'EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED', message: 'Email must be verified to access this resource.' }`.
- [X] **Skip Decorator**:
  - [X] `@SkipEmailVerification()` created with `SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_KEY` metadata constant.
- [X] **Registration Strategy**:
  - [X] Added explicitly to protected controllers immediately after `JwtAuthGuard` (not using global `APP_GUARD`).
  - [X] Ensures no impact to public controllers/endpoints.
- [X] **Add Error Documentation**:
  - [X] Add shared snippet to API docs referencing 403 response & requirement rationale.
- [X] **Testing (Unit)**:
  - [X] Guard unit tests added (`email-verified.guard.spec.ts`).
