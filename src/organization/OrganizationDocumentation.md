# Organization Management Module - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Organization Management
- **Organization CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update organization details
- **Subscription Integration**: Organization creation restricted to active subscribers via `ActiveSubscriptionGuard`
- **Owner Management**: Only organization owners can update organization settings

### Member Management & Role-Based Access Control
- **Role Hierarchy**: Owner > Manager > Staff
- **Role Management**: Owners and managers can update member roles (with restrictions)
- **Access Control**: `OrganizationRolesGuard` enforces role-based permissions
- **Role Validation**: Prevents owner role assignment through role updates

### API Endpoints
- `GET /organizations/owned` - List all owned organizations
- `GET /organizations/member` - List all organizations user is in  
- `GET /organizations/{id}/members` - List organization members (requires membership)
- `GET /invitations` - List user's pending invitations
- `POST /organizations` - Create organization (requires active subscription)
- `PUT /organizations/{id}` - Update organization details (owner only)
- `PUT /organizations/{id}/members/{userId}/role` - Update member role (owners/managers only)

### Data Models & Architecture
- **Organization Schema**: Name, owner, subscription, settings with proper MongoDB indexing
- **UserOrgRelationship Schema**: Supports both active memberships and invitation workflow
- **Input/Output DTOs**: Comprehensive validation and transformation with class-transformer
- **Service Layer**: Complete business logic with proper error handling and logging

### Technical Implementation
- **Guard System**: `OrganizationRolesGuard` with `@OrgRoles()` decorator
- **Authentication**: Integrates with existing JWT authentication system
- **Validation**: Input validation with class-validator decorators
- **Transformation**: Automatic DTO transformation with class-transformer
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose schemas and proper indexing

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Subscription System
- Uses `ActiveSubscriptionGuard` to restrict organization creation
- Placeholder for subscription ID integration (needs subscription service integration)

### Authentication System  
- Uses existing `JwtAuthGuard` and `@CurrentUser()` decorator
- Seamlessly integrates with user authentication flow

### User Management
- Leverages existing User schema and CurrentUser functionality
- Member management integrates with user profiles

## 📋 Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

### Email Invitation System
- Send invitation emails to users
- Accept/decline invitation workflow
- Token-based invitation validation
- Automatic invitation acceptance during registration

### Advanced Features
- Organization transfer (change ownership)
- Bulk member management
- Organization deactivation/deletion
- Member activity tracking
